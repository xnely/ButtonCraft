# ButtonCraft

## Description

This is a fabric mod based on the fabric example mod [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod).

All it does is replace the minecraft title and give a chance to gain or lose 10 xp (or, 70% of the time, do nothing) when pressing any in-game button.
This is used for testing of using mixins to modify the minecraft source code.
